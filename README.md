## Technologies Used

* Spring Tool Suite 4
* JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)- using Object Relational Mapping (ORM) class entities were created for each of the tables being interacted with. Each of those classes matched the database column name to the Java object field name.
* Gradle - Used to manage our project dependencies.
* JavaServer Pages (JSPs) - Used to create dynamic content to be displayed to the user based on the objects created by their queries.
* JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) - We used the core tag library in conjunction with JSP Expression language to utilize the JavaBean properties when displaying specific aspects of our objects.
* Amazon Web Services
* Bootstrap CSS framework
* SQL database
